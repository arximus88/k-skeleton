Platform that integrated with company products and provided a unified experience for users. The VHS platform served as a central hub for all Virtually Human Studio products, allowing users to access ZED RUN, Human Park, and other products from a single location.

> Working on the VHS platform was a great opportunity to create a cohesive experience across multiple products.

The platform was designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing for the addition of new products and features as the company grew. It also provided a consistent brand experience across all products, reinforcing the Virtually Human Studio identity.
