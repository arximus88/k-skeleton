Mobile interface of a nurse's workplace in the "Medics" system. Allows marking the completion of patient services (procedures) and generating reports. The app was designed to streamline the workflow of nurses, making it easier for them to track and document patient care.

> Designing for healthcare professionals required a deep understanding of their workflow and needs.

The project involved extensive research into the daily routines and requirements of nurses, ensuring that the app would be a valuable tool in their work. The result was an intuitive interface that reduced administrative burden and allowed nurses to focus more on patient care.
