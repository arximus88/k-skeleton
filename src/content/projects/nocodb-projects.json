After this, I began working on the website UI to prepare it for launch. Alongside the two founders, there were only backend and frontend engineers. We released the first iteration of [zed.run](http://zed.run) and began selling the first batch of Z1 Nakamoto’s digital racehorses.\n\n <br> _&gt; I was thrilled to be a part of ZED RUN from the beginning and see how it grew over time. The experience was invaluable and taught me a lot about designing for emerging markets._\n\nSubsequently, we introduced users to the first utility abilities, which included Breeding and Racing functionality, effectively starting the ZED RUN experience. While the engineering team focused on scaling and bug fixes, I **investigated quality of life updates by reaching out to our customers in Discord** and surveying them. Based on my findings, I designed and added a Racehorse Detailed Page, Racing filtering, a sidebar wallet to make related transactions more visible, and eased transferring racehorses between stables.\n\n <br> As Product Managers and UX Researchers joined the team, we began working more streamlined and **conducting A/B testing for new features**. I worked solo on the design for almost 2 years while the engineering team grew, prompting the need to hire another designer. I **interviewed nearly 10 candidates and hired one, providing mentorship** throughout her tenure.\n\nLater, it was decided to add a new product team, and I conducted another round of interviews to look for a Senior Product Designer. Before I shifted to VHS's next project, Human Park, I also **participated in interviewing the Head of Design for ZED RUN** and helped her transition into the role by sharing knowledge about the project.\n\n <br> _&gt; I am passionate about mentorship and believe that investing time in new designers is crucial to building a stronger design community._\n\n <br> Throughout my work on ZED RUN, I had the opportunity to work closely with the founders, engineers, and other stakeholders to ensure that the product was meeting the needs of the users and the business. **I was responsible for creating and maintaining the design system**, ensuring consistency across all touchpoints, and contributing to the development of new features and functionality.\n\nOverall, I am proud of the work I accomplished on ZED RUN and am excited to see the platform continue to grow and evolve. I believe that my contributions to the project have helped to create a compelling and engaging user experience that will continue to attract new users and drive the success of the platform.",

As a member of the VHS team, I had the opportunity to work on this exciting project, right from its exploration phase. My responsibilities included communicating with a globally dispersed team, exploring native desktop application UI for editing Noods, and designing the first landing page and release version of the website.\n\n_&gt; Working on Human Park was a wild ride - lots of exploration and new challenges that kept me on my toes. But I loved every minute of it._\n\nOne of the most significant achievements of the Human Park project was the successful minting of 9569 NFTs, with over 10k secondary NFTs generated. As a UI/UX designer, I was involved in exploring dozens of mockups with different styling and layouts, to ensure the best possible user experience. I was also responsible for designing the interface that allowed users to customize their own in-game avatars, which were later minted as NFTs on the release date.\n\n\\`\\`\\`json\n\n{\"from\": 21, \"to\": 29}\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nThe launch of Human Park was a huge success, with thousands of customization NFTs sold. As part of my work on the project, I also designed the in-game UI for the Beta release, allowing users to connect with their Eth Wallet through the Metamask browser extension, view their owned NFTs, and customize their Noods further. Users can apply Drifter skins, Emote Dances, and more, to see in-game.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the project was the development of the Obelisks, which were presented to users on the second minting wave. These Obelisks could be opened on the web inventory to achieve Wayfinders or Limited Collection Drifters. The possibilities are endless, and the community is continuously growing, making Human Park one of the most exciting projects in the metaverse today.\n\n_&gt; Designing the UI for a video game was a whole new challenge for me, but I'm stoked to say I pulled it off._\n\nThe Human Park game clients can be downloaded today from the official website and are available for Windows and MacOS. As a member of the team, I am proud to have contributed to this revolutionary project and its success. The project represents the evolution of the PFP, allowing users to use their Noods as a PFP and build endless entertainment experiences, all powered by them. The project's unique approach to user-generated content and community-driven growth is what makes it truly revolutionary, and I am excited to see where it goes next.",
