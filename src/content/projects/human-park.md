Human Park is a revolutionary project by Virtually Human Studio, dedicated to providing a platform for self-expression in the metaverse. As a member of the VHS team, I had the opportunity to work on this exciting project, right from its exploration phase.

> Working on Human Park was a wild ride - lots of exploration and new challenges that kept me on my toes. But I loved every minute of it.

One of the most significant achievements of the Human Park project was the successful minting of 9569 NFTs, with over 10k secondary NFTs generated. As a UI/UX designer, I was involved in exploring dozens of mockups with different styling and layouts, to ensure the best possible user experience. I was also responsible for designing the interface that allowed users to customize their own in-game avatars, which were later minted as NFTs on the release date.

The launch of Human Park was a huge success, with thousands of customization NFTs sold. As part of my work on the project, I also designed the in-game UI for the Beta release, allowing users to connect with their Eth Wallet through the Metamask browser extension, view their owned NFTs, and customize their Noods further. Users can apply Drifter skins, Emote Dances, and more, to see in-game.

One of the most exciting aspects of the project was the development of the Obelisks, which were presented to users on the second minting wave. These Obelisks could be opened on the web inventory to achieve Wayfinders or Limited Collection Drifters. The possibilities are endless, and the community is continuously growing, making Human Park one of the most exciting projects in the metaverse today.
