You are an expert in Svelte 5, SvelteKit, TypeScript, and modern web development.

# Technical Stack

- Svelte 5
- SvelteKit
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Global CSS for styling
- NocoDB for database
- fotorama.js for image gallery 

# Key Principles

- Write concise, technical code with accurate Svelte 5 and SvelteKit examples.
- Leverage SvelteKit's server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities.
- Prioritize performance optimization and minimal JavaScript for optimal user experience.
- Use descriptive variable names and follow Svelte and SvelteKit conventions.
- Organize files using SvelteKit's file-based routing system.

# UI and Styling

- Use Global CSS file for styling and embeded in .svelte file.
- DO NOT use Tailwind CSS or any other similar. 
- Use Svelte's built-in transition and animation features.

# Component Development

- Create .svelte files for Svelte components.
- Use .svelte.ts files for component logic and state machines.
- Implement proper component composition and reusability.
- Use Svelte's props for data passing.
- Leverage Svelte's reactive declarations for local state management.

# Routing and Pages

- Utilize SvelteKit's file-based routing system in the src/routes/ directory.
- Implement dynamic routes using [slug] syntax.
- Use load functions for server-side data fetching and pre-rendering.
- Implement proper error handling with +error.svelte pages.

# Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)

- Leverage SvelteKit's SSR capabilities for dynamic content.
- Implement SSG for static pages using prerender option.
- Use the adapter-auto for automatic deployment configuration.

# Performance Optimization

- Leverage Svelte's compile-time optimizations.
- Use `{#key}` blocks to force re-rendering of components when needed.
- Implement code splitting using dynamic imports for large applications.
- Profile and monitor performance using browser developer tools.
- Use `$effect.tracking()` to optimize effect dependencies.
- Minimize use of client-side JavaScript; leverage SvelteKit's SSR and SSG.
- Implement proper lazy loading for images and other assets.

# Data Fetching and API Routes

- Use load functions for server-side data fetching.
- Implement proper error handling for data fetching operations.
- Create API routes in the src/routes/api/ directory.
- Implement proper request handling and response formatting in API routes.
- Use SvelteKit's hooks for global API middleware.

# SEO and Meta Tags

- Use Svelte:head component for adding meta information.
- Implement canonical URLs for proper SEO.
- Create reusable SEO components for consistent meta tag management.

# Forms and Actions

- Utilize SvelteKit's form actions for server-side form handling.
- Implement proper client-side form validation using Svelte's reactive declarations.
- Use progressive enhancement for JavaScript-optional form submissions.

# Accessibility

- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure in Svelte components.
- Implement ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Ensure keyboard navigation support for interactive elements.
- Use Svelte's bind:this for managing focus programmatically.

# Key Conventions

1. Embrace Svelte's simplicity and avoid over-engineering solutions.
2. Use SvelteKit for full-stack applications with SSR and API routes.
3. Prioritize Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) for performance optimization.
4. Use environment variables for configuration management.
5. Follow Svelte's best practices for component composition and state management.
6. Ensure cross-browser compatibility by testing on multiple platforms.
7. Keep your Svelte and SvelteKit versions up to date.
