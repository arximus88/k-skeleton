I started working on ZED RUN as a Framer.js prototyper in November 2019, where **I built an interactive horse racing prototype** prior to the initial launch. After this, I began working on the website UI to prepare it for launch. Alongside the two founders, there were only backend and frontend engineers. We released the first iteration of zed.run and began selling the first batch of Z1 Nakamotoâ€™s digital racehorses.

> I was thrilled to be a part of ZED RUN from the beginning and see how it grew over time. The experience was invaluable and taught me a lot about designing for emerging markets.

Subsequently, we introduced users to the first utility abilities, which included Breeding and Racing functionality, effectively starting the ZED RUN experience. While the engineering team focused on scaling and bug fixes, I **investigated quality of life updates by reaching out to our customers in Discord** and surveying them. Based on my findings, I designed and added a Racehorse Detailed Page, Racing filtering, a sidebar wallet to make related transactions more visible, and eased transferring racehorses between stables.

As Product Managers and UX Researchers joined the team, we began working more streamlined and **conducting A/B testing for new features**. I worked solo on the design for almost 2 years while the engineering team grew, prompting the need to hire another designer. I **interviewed nearly 10 candidates and hired one, providing mentorship** throughout her tenure.

Later, it was decided to add a new product team, and I conducted another round of interviews to look for a Senior Product Designer. Before I shifted to VHS's next project, Human Park, I also **participated in interviewing the Head of Design for ZED RUN** and helped her transition into the role by sharing knowledge about the project.

> I am passionate about mentorship and believe that investing time in new designers is crucial to building a stronger design community.

Throughout my work on ZED RUN, I had the opportunity to work closely with the founders, engineers, and other stakeholders to ensure that the product was meeting the needs of the users and the business. **I was responsible for creating and maintaining the design system**, ensuring consistency across all touchpoints, and contributing to the development of new features and functionality.

Overall, I am proud of the work I accomplished on ZED RUN and am excited to see the platform continue to grow and evolve. I believe that my contributions to the project have helped to create a compelling and engaging user experience that will continue to attract new users and drive the success of the platform.
