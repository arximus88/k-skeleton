# My K-Project: Personal Website

Welcome to my K-Project, a personal website built with create-svelte. I've designed and developed this project to showcase my work and share my thoughts with the world.

## I used Svelte Kit

If you want to create a similar project or explore my code, you can start by setting up a new Svelte project:

- reate a new project in the current directory
  `npm create svelte@latest`

- or create a new project in a folder called my-app
  `npm create svelte@latest my-app`

## Local Development

To start working on the project, first, clone the repository and install the dependencies with npm install (or pnpm install or yarn). Then, start a development server:
`npm run dev`

### or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab

`npm run dev -- --open`
This will open a local development environment where you can make changes and see them in real-time.

## Building for Production

To create a production-ready version of the website:
`npm run build`
You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

If you plan to deploy your app, you may need to install an adapter for your target environment.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## About Me

I'm passionate about web development and love working with Svelte to create interactive, high-performance websites. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on this GitHub repository. Happy coding!
